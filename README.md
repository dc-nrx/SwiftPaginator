# Paginator

ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§

Even though does the job properly, at the moment undergoes a major architectural refactor. (the view model part, mostly)

Thus, should anyone like to use it in his or her project - you might want to wait a little bit for the new version.

--------

An abstract paginator, thoroughly tested.

Can be used with networking, DB or whatever else. 
Except for the paginator itself, there's also a paginator-based view model,
which can be used to show a "paginatable" list in a few lines of code.
